## Authentication

### Phase 1: Minimal Risk, Highest Value âœ…

These improvements provide immediate benefits with minimal risk of introducing new issues.

#### 1. Enhanced Error Monitoring âœ…

- **Purpose**: Improve debugging capabilities without changing functionality
- **Implementation**:
  - Added structured console logging with consistent prefixes (`[Auth]`)
  - Added emojis for visual distinction between different log types
  - Added more detailed error reporting with status codes
  - Added clear logging for all authentication state transitions

#### 2. Improved Loading Indicators âœ…

- **Purpose**: Better user experience during authentication state transitions
- **Implementation**:
  - Enhanced loading UI during authentication state verification
  - Added informative text explaining the loading process
  - Added transition messages during redirects
  - Improved error message display in the login form

### Phase 2: Low Risk, High Value

These improvements add functionality with minimal changes to core authentication logic.

#### 3. Graceful Network Error Fallbacks

- **Purpose**: Handle connection issues gracefully
- **Implementation**:
  - Add offline detection for authentication operations
  - Provide clear messaging when network issues occur
  - Implement retry mechanisms for failed network requests
  - Cache authentication attempts for retry when connection is restored

#### 4. Better Token Expiration Handling

- **Purpose**: Prevent confusing experiences when sessions expire
- **Implementation**:
  - Check token expiration before making API calls
  - Add JWT expiration time validation on the client side
  - Implement graceful session expiration with clear user guidance
  - Add silent refresh for tokens that are about to expire

### Phase 3: Medium Risk, Medium Value

These improvements require more substantial changes but offer important benefits.

#### 5. Rate Limiting for Login Attempts

- **Purpose**: Prevent brute force attacks and account lockouts
- **Implementation**:
  - Add client-side tracking of failed login attempts
  - Implement progressive delays between retries
  - Provide clear feedback on remaining attempts
  - Reset counters after successful login

#### 6. Session Persistence Improvements

- **Purpose**: More predictable and user-friendly session management
- **Implementation**:
  - Add configurable session timeout settings
  - Implement session extension on user activity
  - Provide countdown warnings before session expiration
  - Offer "Remember this device" functionality with extended tokens

### Phase 4: Higher Risk, High Value

These improvements require significant changes to the authentication architecture.

#### 7. Auth State Consistency Checks

- **Purpose**: Ensure UI state always matches auth state
- **Implementation**:
  - Add periodic token validation checks
  - Implement auth state observers to detect inconsistencies
  - Add automated recovery from invalid states
  - Create debugging and audit logs for state transitions

#### 8. Advanced Debugging Tools

- **Purpose**: Accelerate troubleshooting of authentication issues
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a debug mode toggle (disabled in production)
  - Add detailed authentication flow tracing
  - Implement anonymous error reporting for authentication failures
  - Add user-facing diagnostic tools for common issues

## User Interface

### Phase 1: Core UI/UX Improvements âœ…

These improvements focus on enhancing the user experience with minimal risk.

#### 1. Authentication State Loading Management âœ…

- **Purpose**: Prevent UI flashing between unauthenticated/authenticated states
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `AuthStateWrapper` component that delays rendering content until auth state is determined
  - Implemented a maximum waiting time (2 seconds) to ensure content is always displayed
  - Added visually pleasing loading indicator with context message
  - Fixed issue where login/signup buttons appear briefly on refresh for logged-in users

#### 2. Multi-Step Form for Meeting Creation âœ…

- **Purpose**: Break down complex forms into more manageable steps
- **Implementation**:
  - Converted the meeting creation form into a 3-step wizard
  - Added visual progress indicator showing current step and completion status
  - Implemented per-step validation to guide users through the process
  - Added clear navigation between steps with back/next buttons
  - Maintained a consistent minimum height to prevent layout shifts

### Phase 2: Enhanced Visual Design

These improvements will focus on visual polish and consistency.

#### 3. Design System Implementation

- **Purpose**: Create consistent visual language across the application
- **Implementation**:
  - Define a comprehensive color palette with primary/secondary colors and semantic colors
  - Create a typography scale with clear hierarchy
  - Design consistent component styles (buttons, inputs, cards)
  - Implement spacing and layout guidelines

#### 4. Responsive Design Improvements

- **Purpose**: Ensure optimal experience across all devices
- **Implementation**:
  - Review and optimize layouts for mobile devices
  - Implement adaptive components that change presentation based on screen size
  - Ensure touch-friendly interactions for mobile users
  - Test and optimize for tablet view

### Phase 3: Interaction Enhancements

These improvements will focus on making interactions more engaging and intuitive.

#### 5. Transitions and Animations

- **Purpose**: Make state changes more intuitive and engaging
- **Implementation**:
  - Add subtle transitions between pages and states
  - Implement micro-interactions for common actions
  - Create loading and success animations
  - Ensure animations are respectful of reduced motion preferences

#### 6. Guided User Onboarding

- **Purpose**: Help new users understand the application
- **Implementation**:
  - Create first-time user onboarding flow
  - Design contextual help tooltips for complex features
  - Implement empty states with helpful guidance
  - Add subtle hints for unused features
